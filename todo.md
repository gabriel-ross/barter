### TODO
* Get WithOffset and WithLimit working for list query builder
* struct models
    - should struct models contain references?
* request service
* response service
* get list queries working
* figure out whether response should use generics or interfaces
* firestore pagination uses document refrences 
* I think I'm doing too much in the main package. Filter query customization doesn't need to be that generic
* Need some way to pass the self URL for user rendering**
